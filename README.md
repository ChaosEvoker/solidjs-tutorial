## Introduction

This is a learning project for SolidJS. Basically, I just went through the official SolidJS tutorials and took notes as I understood things. If you have any questions about this, feel free to hit me up on Teams. My notes are taken from the perspective of someone who is pretty familiar with functional React so there will be a lot of comparisons to things that exist in React and how they compare and relate to things in SolidJS.

## Usage

First, this project requires Node v18. If you don't already have NVM installed to easily manage and swap between different versions of Node it might be good to get that setup since the Portal (at time of writing) runs off Node v14. You can [click here to see how to install NVM on Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Then you can run:

```bash
# install the version you need for Portal
nvm install 14
# install the version you need for this project
nvm install latest
```

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

To install pnpm on your computer you can run:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
Then you can run:

```bash
pnpm install
```
To start the project after installing run

```bash
npm start
```
